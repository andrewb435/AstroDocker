# Dockerized Astroneer Server with AstroLauncher #
This is a docker container build on Debian 12 (bookworm) with [Wine](https://www.winehq.org/) and the superb work of Ricky Davis' [AstroLauncher](https://github.com/ricky-davis/AstroLauncher) to do the heavy lifting to run an Astroneer dedicated server.

## IMPORTANT NOTE ##
Because of a limitation in Wine's bcrypt implementation, WINE does not provide the full featureset that AstroServer.exe needs to run. The server runs with an Engine.ini option to disable encryption, and *all clients must have this block in their Engine.ini* in order to connect.

%APPDATA%\Local\Astro\Saved\Config\WindowsNoEditor\Engine.ini
```
[SystemSettings]
net.AllowEncryption=False
```

## Docker Compose ##
This has only ever been tested by building and launching with docker compose locally.

### First launch ###
The first launch will download components to build the container, download AstroLauncher, generate some basic config file entries based on ENV, and download the actual AstroServer files. I recommend running it interactively first time to better monitor progress.
```
docker compose up
```
### Regular launches ###
After the built container has been cached on your machine, you should be able to run normally with a detached compose
```
docker compose up -d
```
